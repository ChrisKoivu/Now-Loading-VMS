    php artisan tinker
    $user = new App\User;
    $user->name="Admin";
    $user->email="admin@localhost.com";
    $user->password=bcrypt('1234');
    $user->save();
 


# Create  Admin User
To designate a registered user as an admin, type the following
at the command line:<br>
     
     php artisan tinker
     use App\User;
     User::where('email', 'admin@localhost.com')->update(['role' => 'admin']);
